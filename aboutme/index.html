    <p>    Hello everyone!  My name is Darren Sheffer and I am from Northern Utah.  I was born and raised there and really enjoy </p>
    <p>spending some of the warmer fall days in the mountains, when the trees are all kinds of different colors.  Some other things</p>
    <p>I enjoy are playing video games, drawing, reading, and writing.  An interesting fact about me is I have traveled to 49 of the</p>
    <p>50 United States. (Missing Hawaii)</p>
