          With all the information that is readily available online, I am here to offer a small
        portion of my prints, ideas, and settings in hopes it helps you be able to print higher
        quality prints for yourselves.  
          There are many types of ways to bring your art into the real world like drawing a picture
        or crafting using clay, wood, or steel.  These, however, take years of practice and in some
        cases very expensive tools to create, that is why my preferred way is to use 3D and laser
        engraving.  These two methods allow you to create just about anything you can imagine!  Want
        to make your own flowerpots with distinct and original designs?  Use a 3D printer to bring
        your vision to reality!  Maybe you want to add a nativity scene etched into wood or tile.  
        Use a laser engraver to precisely create the perfect decoration for the holidays!

      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>
          Welcome to the world of 3D printing!  There is an infinite number of things you can do with a
        3D printer.  Just a few examples are bath toys for children or yourself, decorative shelving
        objects, prints to fix or replace broken parts of other objects, and even gifts.
          Meet Clover!
        This 3D print was my first attempt at designing my own object for 3D printing.  I started by using
        references to create a 3D model in Blender.  This process can be skipped if you decide to purchase
        or download a file already made.  I then transferred the Blender file into a program called Prusa
        Slicer that was set up for my printer.  In Prusa Slicer, I was able to adjust the printer and file
        settings to be ready for the final print.  After the printing was done, I used Superglue to glue
        the halves together.  After a little bit of sanding, I sprayed a few coats of primer onto it and
        painted it.  This print was given to my friend who used it for a staff in their cosplay.  If you
        have a 3D printer and want to try your hand at making an original design, both Blender and Prusa
        Slicer are free software and have tutorials for any questions you might have YouTube.

      <h3>Laser Printing</h3>
      <p>
          Laser engravings are becoming more and more popular these days.  Whether you are a beginner trying
        it as a hobby, or an experienced craftsman looking to start or expand your business, there is a laser
        engraver that is just right for you!  
	        With a laser engraver machine, you can produce precise and repeatable engravings and cuttings on a
        variety of materials.  These include wood, stone, foam, glass, acrylic, and fabric.  The engraving does
        not have to be flat!  For example, if you want to engrave a horse onto a mug for a present, the engraver
        can do that!  Or maybe you want to engrave a Ninetails that you drew into wood, it will create your
        masterpiece in perfect detail!
